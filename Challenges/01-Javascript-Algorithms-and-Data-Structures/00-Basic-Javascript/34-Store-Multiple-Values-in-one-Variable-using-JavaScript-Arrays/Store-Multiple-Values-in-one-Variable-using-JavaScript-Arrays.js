/*
  Basic JavaScript - Lesson 37: Store Multiple Values in one Variable using JavaScript Arrays
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  With JavaScript `array` variables, we can store several 
  pieces of data in one place.

  You start an array declaration with an 
  opening square bracket, end it with a 
  closing square bracket, and put a comma 
  between each entry, like this:

  `var sandwich = ["peanut butter", "jelly", "bread"];`

   LESSON
   -------------
     Modify the new array `myArray` so that it 
    contains both a `string` and a `number` (in 
    that order).

    Hint:
    ------------
    Refer to the example code in the text editor 
    if you get stuck.

*/

// Solution:
var myArray = [
    "Trey",
    28
];

/* Tests needed to meet:
   ----------------------------
   * `myArray` should be an `array`.
   * The first item in `myArray` should be a `string`.
   * The second item in `myArray` should be a `number`.
